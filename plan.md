# Plan 

A plan to hold ourselves accountable. 

We want to finish this project in 4 weeks, so we'll divide it into 4 phases. Each of these should last a week. 

Phase 1: Data Exploration, Augmentation, Cleaning 

We will read and organize the data into whatever formats seem useful. 

We'll try to augment the data in some way if it helps - for example, by scraping IMDB pages or Rottentomatoes percentages for the movies. 

Phase 2: Baseline modeling and exploration 

First, we'll try to build a baseline model to compare performance against. This should be fairly common-sense based and help us get our feet wet. 

Second, we'll do some exploratory analysis and try to create useful visualizations. 

Phase 3: Model Selection and Analysis 

We'll pick the model(s) that we want to explore and then implement them. 

Phase 4: Writeup

We'll write up the results in a main notebook, organize the repo, and publish blog posts to share our work.
